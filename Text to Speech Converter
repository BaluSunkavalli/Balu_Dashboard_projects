The Java-based text-to-speech converter mini-project aims to develop an application that allows users to input text and converts it into audible speech. 
This project utilizes Java's Text-to-Speech (TTS) libraries to generate speech output from text input. 
Users can input any text, and the program will produce corresponding speech output, making it useful for accessibility, educational, and entertainment purposes.
